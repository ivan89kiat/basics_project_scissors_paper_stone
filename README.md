# basics_project_scissors_paper_stone
This project is to create a basic version of Scissors Paper Stone where the user inputs one of "scissors", "paper", or "stone", 
the program internally randomly chooses scissors, paper, or stone, and the program outputs whether the user won, the program won, or it's a draw.
Rules: scissors beats paper, paper beats stone, and stone beats scissors. If both parties choose the same object, it's a draw.

This project is created via what have been taught in the Basics Coding Bootcamp which consists of declaring variables, function and boolean.
